        <h3>Text 2</h3>
        <!-- paragraph 1 -->
        <p>
          <span>All around the world, lawyers generate more </span
          ><strong><span>hostility</span></strong
          ><span> than the members of any other </span
          ><strong><span>profession</span></strong
          ><span>—with the possible </span
          ><strong><span>exception</span></strong
          ><span> of </span><strong><span>journalism</span></strong
          ><span>. But there are few places where </span
          ><strong><span>clients</span></strong
          ><span> have more </span><strong><span>grounds</span></strong
          ><span> for </span><strong><span>complaint</span></strong
          ><span> than America.</span>
        </p>
        <!-- paragraph 2 -->
        <p>
          <span>During the </span><strong><span>decade</span></strong
          ><span> before the economic crisis, </span
          ><em title="在……方面花费">spend on</em
          ><span> legal services in America grew twice </span
          ><em title="和……一样快">as fast as</em><span> </span
          ><strong><span>inflation</span></strong
          ><span>. <sup>(26)</sup><u>The </span><strong><span>beast</span></strong
            ><span> lawyers made </span
            ><strong><span>skyscrapers-full</span></strong
            ><span> of money, </span><strong><span>tempting</span></strong
            ><span> ever more students to </span><strong><span>pile</span></strong
            ><span> into law school.</u> But most law graduates never get a </span
          ><strong><span>big-firm</span></strong
          ><span> job. Many of them instead become the kind of </span
          ><strong><span>nuisance-lawsuit</span></strong
          ><span> </span><strong><span>filer</span></strong
          ><span> that makes the </span><strong><span>tort</span></strong
          ><span> system a </span><strong><span>costly</span></strong
          ><span> </span><strong><span>nightmare</span></strong
          ><span>.</span>
        </p>

        <!-- paragraph 3 -->
        <p>
          <span>There many reasons for this. One is the </span
          ><strong><span>excessive</span></strong
          ><span>
            costs of a legal education. <sup>(27)</sup><u>There is just one path for a lawyer in
                most </span
              >America states<span>: a four-year </span
              ><em title="学士学位">undergraduate degree</em><span> in some </span
              ><strong><span>unrelated</span></strong
              ><span> subject, than a three-year law </span
              ><strong><span>degree</span></strong
              ><span> at one of 200 law schools </span
              ><strong><span>authorized</span></strong
              ><span> by </span
              ><em title="美国律师协会">the America Bar Association</em
              ><span> and an expensive </span
              ><strong><span>preparation</span></strong
              ><span> for </span><em title="律师资格考试">the bar exam</em
              ><span>.</u> This leaves today&#39;s average law-school </span
          ><strong><span>graduate</span></strong
          ><span> with $100,000 of </span><strong><span>debt</span></strong
          ><span>
            on top of undergraduate debts. Law-school debt means that they have
            to work </span
          ><strong><span>fearsomely</span></strong
          ><span> hard.</span>
        </p>

        <!-- paragraph 4 -->
        <p>
          <sup>(28)</sup><u><strong><span>Reforming</span></strong
            ><span> the system would help both lawyers and their customers. </span
            ><strong><span>Sensible</span></strong
            ><span>
              ideas have been around for a long time, but state-level bodies that </span
            ><strong><span>govern</span></strong

            ><span> </span><strong><span>implement</span></strong
            ><span>
              them.</u> One idea is to allow people to study law as an undergraduate
            degree. Another is to let students </span
          ><em title="参加">sit for</em
          ><span>
            the bar after only two years of law school. If the bar exam is truly
            a </span

          ><span>

            Students who do not need the </span

        <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
        <p>
          <sup>(29)</sup><u>
            <span>The other reason why costs are so high is the </span
                ><strong><span>restrictive</span></strong
