        <p>
          In order to &quot;change lives for the better&quot; and reduce
          &quot;dependency&quot;, George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
          introduced the &quot;upfront work search&quot; scheme. Only if the
          jobless arrive at the jobcentre with a CV, register for online job
          search, and start looking for work will they be eligible for benefit —
          and then they should report weekly rather than fortnightly. What could
          be more reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
          More apparent reasonableness followed. There will now be a seven-day
          wait for the jobseeker&#39;s allowance.&quot; Those first few days
          should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on&quot;, he
          claimed.&quot; We&#39;re doing these things because we know they help
          people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get into work
          faster&quot;. Help? Really? On first hearing, this was the socially
          concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete
          with &quot;reforms&quot; to an obviously indulgent system that demands
          too little effort the newly unemployed to find work, and subsidies
          laziness. What motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal for
          &quot;fundamental fairness&quot; — protecting the taxpayer,
          controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving
          claimants received their benefits.

          Losing a job is hurting: you don&#39;t skip down to the jobcentre with
          a song in your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your
          income from the generous state. It is financially terrifying,
          psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and
          extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you are now
          exclude form the work environment that offers purpose and structure in
          your life. Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family
          and pay the bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly unemployed what
          they want and the answer is always: a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into
          dependency—permanent dependency if you can get it—supported by a state
          only too ready to indulge your falsehood. It is as though 20 years of
          ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit administration
          system never happened. The principle of British welfare is no longer
          that you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and
          receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. Even the very
          phrase &quot;jobseeker&#39;s allowance&quot; is about redefining the
          unemployed as a &quot;jobseeker&quot; who had no fundamental right to
          a benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance
          contributions. Instead the claimant receives a time-limited
          &quot;allowance&quot;, conditional on actively seeking a job; no
          entitlement and no insurance, at £71.70 a week, one of the least
          generous in the EU.
