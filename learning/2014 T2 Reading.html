        <p>
          <span
            >All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the
            members of any other profession—with the possible exception of
            journalism. But there are few places where clients have more grounds
            for complaint than America.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span
            >During the decade before the economic crisis, spend on legal
            services in America grew twice as fast as inflation. The beast
            lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students
            to pile into law school. But most law graduates never get a big-firm
            job. Many of them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer
            that makes the tort system a costly nightmare.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span
            >There many reasons for this. One is the excessive costs of a legal
            education. There is just one path for a lawyer in most America
            states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated subject,
            than a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools authorized by
            the America Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar
            exam. This leaves today&#39;s average law-school graduate with
            $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts. Law-school debt
            means that they have to work fearsomely hard.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span
            >Reforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers.
            Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but state-level
            bodies that govern the profession have been too conservation to
            implement them. One idea is to allow people to study law as an
            undergraduate degree. Another is to let students sit for the bar
            after only two years of law school. If the bar exam is truly a stern
            enough test for a would-be lawyer, those who can sit it earlier
            should be allowed to do so. Students who do not need the extra
            training could cut their debt mountain by a third.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span
            >The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive
            guild-like ownership structure of the business. Exception in the
            District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law
            firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow. There is pressure
            for change from within the profession, but opponents of change among
            the regulators insist that keeping outsiders out of a law firm
            isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than serve
            clients ethically.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <span
            >In fact, allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms to use
            technology and to employ professional managers to focus on improving
            firms&#39; efficiency. After all, other counties, such as Australia
            and Britain, have started liberalizing their legal professions.
            America should follow.</span
